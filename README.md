## How to play

- Recommend a keyboard with a Numpad for playing (especially the Keychron Q6 Custom Mechanical Keyboard with blue switches //jk)
- `W,S`: for moving the left paddle up/down respectively (player1)
- `8,5`: for moving the right paddle up/down respectively (player2)
- `L`: for throwing the ball after any player gets scored or starts the game (last pressed key must not be `L`)
- `btnD`: like `L` but can throw without exception
- `btnU`: reset the game
